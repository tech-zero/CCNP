## Day 1 Review Lab 2

### Objective
In this lab, we continue to review configuration and troubleshooting concepts covered in  
ENCOR 350-401 exam topics. 

### Topology
In this lab, you are responsible for completing the multi-VRF configuration of the network  
supporting sales users and HR users.  On completion, there should be full end-to-end  
rechability, and the two groups should not be able to communicate with each other.  
Be careful to verify that your configurations meet the provided specifications and that  
the devices perform as required.  

For this lab, you need three routers (IOS, IOSv, or IOS XE), three switches (Layer 2/Layer  
3), and four Windows or Linux PCs.
