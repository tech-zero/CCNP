### Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS)

> A communications protocol designed to provide authentication, 
> data integrity, and confidentiality for communications between
> two applications, over a datagram transport protocol such as
> User Datagram Protocol (UDP). DTLS is based on TLS, and it
> includes enhancements such as sequence numbers and retransmission
> capability to compensate for the unreliable nature of UDP.
> DTLS is defined in IETF [RFC 4347.](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4347)
